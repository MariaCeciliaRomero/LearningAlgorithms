## Algorithms Included
### Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort

### Graphs
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Recursion
- Factorial
- Fibonacci Sequence

### Others
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming examples (e.g., Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence)
