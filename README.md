# Learning Algorithms 

✨Hi everyone, I’m Cecilia, and I invite you to solve algorithms with me!

Welcome to the **Learning Algorithms** repository! This is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in different programming languages. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your skills, this repository aims to help you understand and practice key concepts in computer science.

🤖 Over 80% of the tests given to software developers involve algorithms. That’s why this repository will be incredibly useful in helping you tackle challenges in the programming world.

As a programmer, you need to develop a truly unique way of thinking.

💻 "Learning Algorithms" is a personal project aimed at learning and practising programming algorithms from a fundamental perspective. This repository will feature implementations of various classic algorithms and data structures, as well as solutions to typical problems in the IT world, all built from scratch.

⚙️ I decided to create "Learning Algorithms" as a way to strengthen programming skills, learn to solve logical problems, and enhance analytical abilities. I also want to share this learning journey with the community so that others interested in algorithms can follow the progress and find practical solutions and examples.

⚙️ This project will serve as a resource for both learning and practice, designed to be a guide for anyone looking to delve into the theory and practice of algorithms and data structures.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of algorithms—not only how to implement them but also how they work internally and how to optimise them for different scenarios.

✔️ Learn fundamental algorithms: Become familiar with the most common algorithms, such as search, sorting, and recursion, among others.

✔️ Apply algorithms to practical problems: Solve typical programming problems using algorithms, thereby improving problem-solving skills.

✔️ Optimise algorithms: Learn to optimise algorithm performance by reducing time and space complexity, and understand the importance of efficiency in programming.

✔️ Understand data structures: Study and apply fundamental data structures, such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, to efficiently store and manipulate data.

✔️ Enhance skills in algorithmic analysis: Develop the ability to analyse and evaluate algorithm efficiency using Big-O notation.

✔️ Build a strong foundation for advanced studies: Establish a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures to tackle more complex challenges, such as graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and computational theory.

✔️ Contribute to the learning community: Share progress and solutions in this repository to help others learn alongside me and provide clear, well-documented solutions.
